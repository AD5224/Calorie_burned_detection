The Calorie Burn Detection System predicts the number of calories burned during physical activity using accelerometer and gyroscope data. The system processes sensor data and applies a RandomForest Regressor model to estimate calorie expenditure. It features a web interface where users input their activity data, and the backend (Python script) performs the prediction and returns the result. The project is organized with a clean structure, including separate folders for static assets (images, CSS, JS) and templates (HTML), ensuring an interactive and user-friendly experience.

1. Setup Environment:
   
Install dependencies: Make sure you have Python installed. Then, install the necessary libraries using pip:
- pip install -r requirements.txt

If you don't have a requirements.txt file, you can manually install dependencies like:
- pip install flask scikit-learn pandas numpy
- flask for the web framework
- scikit-learn for the machine learning model
- pandas and numpy for data manipulation
  
2. Run the Python Script:
- The calorie_detection.py script can be run directly to test the model and predict calorie burn.
- python calorie_detection.py
- This will load the trained RandomForest model, process the input data, and print the predicted calorie burn in the terminal.

3. Start the Web Server:
If you're using Flask for the web interface, run the server using:
- python app.py
- In this case, app.py should be the Flask web application that handles user input and interfaces with calorie_detection.py to get the calorie burn predictions.

4. Open the Web Application:
Open a browser and navigate to the local server (typically http://127.0.0.1:5000/):
- http://127.0.0.1:5000/
- You should now see the web page where you can input sensor data and get the predicted calorie burn.

5. Running JavaScript and Frontend:
- The web page will be rendered with index.html located in the templates/ folder.
- styles.css and script.js will handle the styling and interactions on the frontend.
